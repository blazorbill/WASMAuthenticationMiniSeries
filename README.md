# WASMAuthenticationMiniSeries
This code goes along with the Blazor WebAssembly Authentication Mini-Series found at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL99f7HyLVqfNn__HH3MPvr4lwD3l4AinK.

Please ensure that before you run this you create the database by going to the Package Manager Console and entering the following commands:  

add-migration initialdb  
update-database

This will create a users.db in the WASMAuthenticationDemo.Server folder.
